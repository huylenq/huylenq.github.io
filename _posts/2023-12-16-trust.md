### Why does trusting matter?

It is an _heuristic_ to free your mental capacity. It gives you the basis to explore and build upon.

Because there is no other way to live. Doubt everything by default will overwhelm you to a broken point. At the bottom of it, there's a line you must draw to give the benefit of the doubt to many things passing that line.

### What do I trust?

- Personal task managing, I trust my GTD system.
- Evolving a code base, I trust the unit tests suites.
- Working in an organized team, I trust the process.
- Working with people, I trust them by default.
- Learning, I trust my SRS will retain the facts.

I trust the yinyang philosophy, that is there are exceptions in every rules (languages' grammar is a prominent example):

- It's okay to skip your GTD cycles sometimes if you're enjoying whatever you're doing.
- You shouldn't rely on unit tests as the sole mean for safety net.
- Don't follow a process arrogantly.
- You probably shouldn't entrust stranger with important matters.
- You should be ready to doubt what you've known.
- I don't trust information without validating, especially those that will drive to a decision.

### Back to square one, aren't we?

So there is doubt in the corner of every given trust, isn't this writing is basically pointless?

If there's a definite answer to whether to trust a thing or not, life would be easy, isn't it? It will also be boring. And, even an atom is not indivisible. There're many components in a "thing". There're many ideas in a book, there're many people in a team, there's many principles in a methodology.

While we would love to have a consistent and holistic view over every thing that would make a word--a "bird" is a bird--life is fascinating the that way. We cannot trust that we are right.
